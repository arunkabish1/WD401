# Testing Framework Configuration:
## **Jest**
* Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
* Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure the correctness of your JavaScript code.
## Setting Up Jest:
* Run the following command to install Jest as a development dependency.
```bash  
npm install --save-dev jest
```
* Create a folder with name _ _tests_ _ in the root of the project and add the test files in this folder.Then run the run test command.
npm test
* The results display in the terminal.
## **Cypress**

* Cypress is a powerful end-to-end testing framework that makes it easy to write, run, and maintain tests for your web applications.
## Setting Up Cypress:
* Install Cypress as a development dependency:
```bash
npm install --save-dev cypress
```
* create a folder with name cypress in the root of the project.
* Create a cypress.config.js file in the root of the project.
```javascript
const { defineConfig } = require("cypress");

module.exports = defineConfig({
  integration: {
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      // implement node event listeners here
      require("cypress-json-results")({
        on,
        filename: "results.json",
      });
    },
  },
});
```
* Also configure the package.json file with the following command in scripts.
```javascript
"scripts": {
 "cy:test": "npx cypress run"
}
```
* Then run the tests and display the results in the terminal.
```bash
npm run cy:test
```
## Jest for Unit Tests:
Jest is a powerful testing framework with many features to help you write and maintain unit tests for your JavaScript code.
## Cypress for Integration Tests:
Cypress is a powerful, modern end-to-end testing framework for web applications. It is particularly well-suited for integration testing due to its ability to simulate user interactions and verify the application's behavior.
## **Automation of Testing Workflows on GitHub**:

The GitHub repository is configured to automatically run a test suite whenever changes are pushed. The suite utilizes Jest for unit testing and Cypress for end-to-end testing.
## **Github Action**
GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) platform provided by GitHub. It allows you to automate workflows directly within your GitHub repository.

**Workflow File**
* It Create a workflow file in the .github/workflows directory of the project. The workflow file is a YAML file that defines the actions to be executed. The workflow file is named as main.yml.
```javascript
name: Auto test todo app solution
on: push
env:
  PG_DATABASE: wd-todo-test
  PG_USER: postgres
  PG_PASSWORD: changeme
jobs:
  
  run-tests:
    # Containers must run in Linux based operating systems
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Service containers to run with `container-job`
    services:
      # Label used to access the service container
      postgres:
        # Docker Hub image
        image: postgres:11.7
        # Provide the password for postgres
        env:
          POSTGRES_USER: postgres
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: changeme
          POSTGRES_DB: wd-todo-test
        # Set health checks to wait until postgres has started
        options: >-
          --health-cmd pg_isready
          --health-interval 10s
          --health-timeout 5s
          --health-retries 5
        ports:
          - 5432:5432

    steps:
      # Downloads a copy of the code in your repository before running CI tests
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install dependencies
        run:  npm ci

      - name: Run unit tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Run the app
        id: run-app
        run: |
          npm install
          npx sequelize-cli db:drop
          npx sequelize-cli db:create
          npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
          PORT=3000 npm start &
          sleep 5

      - name: Run integration tests
        run: |
          npm install cypress cypress-json-results
          npx cypress run --env STUDENT_SUBMISSION_URL="http://localhost:3000/"
```
* The workflow file that defines the actions to be executed.
